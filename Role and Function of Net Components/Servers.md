Servers can be defined as a role which computers take in order to serve responses to client requests. Servers can deliver a variety of contents to clients, for example, they can act as a DNS server and reply to requests for DNS name resolving, or as a Mail server and reply to requests to read and send e-mails on a specific domain. As a server can be defined as a role, generally speaking, servers can also be clients, clients can also be servers, and both of them are endpoints by definition.
