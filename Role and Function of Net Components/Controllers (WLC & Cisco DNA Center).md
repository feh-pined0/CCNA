A WLC (Wireless LAN Controller) is responsible for managing all the wireless connections to the network. This generally includes the vlan access, general switching / packet encapsulation and proxies for all traffic coming from wireless access points (WAPs) and wireless clients (such as cell phones, notebooks, etc). Practically speaking, WLCs provide all the configuration parameters for WAPs, like passwords and SSIDs and encapsulate and forward traffic (through CAPWAP tunnels).

Cisco DNA Center can be a software or appliance solution for network managing, analysis and monitoring. DNA Center is a network controller that does lots of things, such as monitoring the network, providing configurations and images to network devices (automation), smart network analysis through AI and Machine Learning, managing QoS and security through group policies and much more. It does all this with intent-based architecture, which is a form of building complex networks with tons of configurations and policies, while inputting to the software the business intent for the network.

In general, network controllers serve an important role for managing different aspects of the network, providing a way for configuring lots of devices in a way that is not overwhelming.
