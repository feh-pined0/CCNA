A router is a networking device which is designed to forward packets in one or more networks. It operates at the layer 3 of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) model (The network layer), and thus can check, modify and make decisions based on information that is available in the layer 3 information of the PDU (Protocol Data Unit). Some examples of router activity in a network are:

- Packet routing: a router can verify, between many other things, the source and destination ip addresses of a packet. Based on information about the addressesâ€™ subnet, the router can decide things like if the packet is going to be dropped or forwarded, what is the next hop for this packet, use NAT (Network Address Translation) to modify the addresses, and other things.  
- Load balance: given a specific network, a router can decide what is the best route for a packet to arrive at a given endpoint. If there is more than one route, the router picks the one with the lowest AD (Administrative Distance). In the case that there are 2 or more routes with the same AD, the router distributes traffic between these interfaces. 

Routers are used in a network to forward packets to another network. That network can be either on the same network administration or not (more on this on the Layer 3 switches section).
