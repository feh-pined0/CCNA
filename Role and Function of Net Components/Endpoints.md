Endpoint is a concept that applies to both physical and virtual devices. An endpoint is a device that can be identified and communicate with a given network. This includes devices such as user devices (notebooks and phones, for example), but also servers, ip voice phones, networking devices such as routers and switches, cloud servers and services and many more (IoT). So, in a way, an endpoint can be a client and a server (or better put, a server and a client are both endpoints).
