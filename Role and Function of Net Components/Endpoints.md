Endpoint is a concept that applies to both physical and [[Virtual Machine|virtual devices]]. An endpoint is a device that can be identified and communicate with a given network. This includes devices such as user devices (notebooks and phones, for example), but also [[Servers|servers]], IP voice phones, networking devices such as [[Routers|routers]] and [[Switches|switches]], cloud servers and services and many more (IoT). So, in a way, an endpoint can be a client and a server (or better put, a server and a client are both endpoints).
