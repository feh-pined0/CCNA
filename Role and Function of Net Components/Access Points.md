Access points are devices that connect wireless clients or another access point to a wired network. These devices can be configured in various ways, depending on the intended connection type and network needs. An access point uses RF (Radio Frequency) to transmit data. It can be configured as a root WAP (Wireless Access Point), which is directly connected to the wired network and provide a wireless interface for wireless devices, a repeater, which listens to the RF of another WAP and amplifies it to make it reach further away or a workgroup bridge, which connects wired devices to the wireless network.
