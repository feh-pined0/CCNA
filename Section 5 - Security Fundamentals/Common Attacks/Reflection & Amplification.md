*Reflection* attacks consist in making a huge amount of traffic to be forwarded to the target by a third device. Usually, this consists in a combination of a [[Spoofing]] and [[DoS and DDoS|DoS]].

For example, an attacker (PC1) sends a request for a server (SRV1), using the spoofed IP address of another device (PC2). The server will send the reply to PC2. If PC1 request causes a lot of traffic to be forwarded from SRV1 to PC2, this can cause a bandwidth exhaustion on PC2.
