*Malicious Software* is kind of a class of attacks. In this "class", attacks use custom software to exploit various vulnerabilities in OSs and devices. Malware has many types, but the most popular are:

- **Worms**: this type of malware spreads through emails and the network. These are most famous for their main objective, which is to spread to as much devices as they can. This can be just to slow down a network in general, but they can also contain payloads that execute to cause some damage on infected devices. For example, worms can be used to form [[DoS and DDoS|botnets]].
- **Virus**: a virus can infect other programs in order to hide from the user and the operational system. They often contain payloads that execute as soon as the infected program starts execution, making it hard to diagnose and solve the problem.
- **Trojan Horse**: the trojan horse is often compared to a virus, but they differ in functionality. While the virus generally tries to spread and keep itself on the device, the trojan horse will focus on hiding and hijacking user information such as passwords and credentials. The most used feature of a trojan horse is the key logging, in which the malware will log all key presses on the keyboard and send to the attacker.
