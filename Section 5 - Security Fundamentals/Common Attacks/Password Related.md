*Password Related Attacks* try to get a users credentials by whatever means applied. These generally consist of a combination of brute-force and [[Social Engineering|social engineering]]. Some common types of password attacks are:

- **Guessing**: an attacker can try to guess the password if they already know a username or email. This is hard to happen, but not impossible and can be facilitated if the attacker knows information about the targeted user;
- **Dictionary Attack**: in this case, a program runs through a list of possible/common passwords (called a dictionary) in order to find the correct one. The strength of this attack is based on the user's selected password (if it is a weak password, the attack is very effective);
- **Brute-Force**: this is the more global approach, where a program will run through **every possible combination** of letters, numbers and symbols in order to guess the password. If the password is long or strong, this can take millions of years to resolve, making it a not so effective method;
