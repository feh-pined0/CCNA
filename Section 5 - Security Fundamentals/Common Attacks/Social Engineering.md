By far the most dangerous aspect of any security system are the people. Social Engineering type of attacks focus on getting privileged information from people by deceiving them with available tools. Some common attacks that involve social engineering are:

- **Phishing**: this consists in sending a message (usually email) that tries to appear as if it was sent from a legitimate business (such as Amazon or credit card company). They will contain links that redirect to malicious websites in an attempt to steal credentials or any useful information;
	- Also, phishing can occur on other types of media too, like voice (called **Vishing**) or SMS (**Smishing**);
- **Watering Hole**: this is a multiple step attack, where an attacker will compromise a website and then place malicious links on that. Unsuspecting users that trust the site may click these links and follow along with whatever tactic the attacker may carry on after;
- **Tailgating**: this is a very specific attack, where an attacker will try to gain physical access to a device or an area, by following authorized users in the hope to access these areas with them;
	- This bases of the premise that the people being followed will think the person is authorized too, and will often "hold the door" for them.

There are many more social engineering attacks, but these are the most common.
