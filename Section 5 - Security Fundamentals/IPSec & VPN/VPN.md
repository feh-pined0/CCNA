A *Virtual Private Network* is a network topology that consists in the usage of software to create a virtual LAN between devices or networks (or both). This virtual LAN generally consists of two or more networks connected using a VPN technology over the public internet (such as [[Site-to-Site VPN|IPSec]]). Devices in this VPN can communicate with each other using [[Private Addresses|private]]/[[IPv6 Addressing|unique local]] IP addresses.
