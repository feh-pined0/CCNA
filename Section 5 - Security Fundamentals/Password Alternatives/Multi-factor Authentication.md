By far, the most common way of user authentication is a username+password credential set. In multi-factor authentication, this is classified as **something you know**.

The thing is, something you know can also be known to other people, so even if this is kind of secure, it is not the most secure.

For this, multi-factor authentication defines other credential sets that can be used to authenticate a user:

- **Something you have**: this can be a badge or a phone. This thing (object or device) is used when authenticating a user, alongside with username+password credentials.
- **Something you are**: this is something that can only belong to one person, such as a face ID or biometrics.

Using multiple of these methods greatly increase authentication security.
