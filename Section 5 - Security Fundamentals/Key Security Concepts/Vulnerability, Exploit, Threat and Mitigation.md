These four concepts are essential in understanding any security concepts. They describe different aspects of device/system security:

# Vulnerability

A vulnerability is:
>...any potential weakness that can compromise the [[CIA]] of a system or information.

A vulnerability in itself isn't a risk or problem. For it to be a problem, it must be **exploited**.

# Exploit

An exploit is anything that can be used to take advantage of a vulnerability to carry malicious actions.

>Something that can potentially be used to exploit a system isn't necessarily a exploit by itself.

An example for both concepts above is a [[DoS and DDoS|DoS attack]]. In a DoS attack, the three-way handshake is a **vulnerability**, and sending continuous SYN messages is an **exploit**, but neither the three-way handshake nor the SYN messages are a vulnerability or an exploit by themselves.

# Threat

A threat is:

>...the potential of a vulnerability to be exploited.

So, if a exploit for a vulnerability exists, this creates a possibility of an attack. This is known as a **threat**. In the example above, the DoS attack is a threat.

# Mitigation

A mitigation technique is a way to stop/prevent threats from happening or continuing. For example, a [[NGFW and IPS (Firewall)|signature]] on a IPS Firewall that detects DoS patterns is a mitigation technique.
