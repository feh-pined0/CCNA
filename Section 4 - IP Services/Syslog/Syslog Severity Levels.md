There are seven syslog message severity levels defined by the original RFC standard, where the lower the number, the higher the severity:

- **7 - Debugging**: used for debugging purposes, it represents messages which contain very specific information;
- **6 - Informational**: used to inform about state changes or other minor changes;
- **5 - Notice (or Notification)**: used to inform about more significant state changes and conditions.
- **4 - Warning**: conditions that may or may not impact on some feature's operation;
- **3 - Error**: conditions that can be unexpected and impact on the device's operation;
- **2 - Critical**: conditions that most likely are not expected and can cause problems;
- **1 - Alert**: conditions that require immediate action;
- **0 - Emergency**: conditions that render the entire system unusable;
