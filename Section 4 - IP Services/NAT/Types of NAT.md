NAT has many shapes and forms, created to adequate each situation. For the scope of the CCNA, the following types are relevant:

- **Static NAT**: with one-to-one address translations, static NAT creates a direct relation between two IP addresses (usually private to public address, but not necessarily).  **Statically configured address translations cannot be overloaded** (as in, it is not possible to assign two private addresses to one public address with static NAT);
- **Dynamic NAT**: also uses one-to-one address translations, but this time inside global addresses are dynamically mapped by the router through a pool of addresses;
