There are multiple types of DNS records. These can dictate what type of name or IP address will be resolved or returned:

- **A Record**: resolves a DNS name to an IPv4 address;
- **AAAA Record**: resolves a DNS name to an IPv6 address;
- **CNAME (Canonical Name)**: Resolves a DNS name into another DNS name;
