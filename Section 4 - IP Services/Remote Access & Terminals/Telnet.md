Telnet is a remote access protocol that enables the access of a device's command line interface through an **emulated terminal** formed across a network.

Telnet does not have encryption. This is because it is a very old protocol. By today's standards, telnet is considered insecure and should not be used in production environments.

Telnet servers listen to connections on port **TCP/23**.
