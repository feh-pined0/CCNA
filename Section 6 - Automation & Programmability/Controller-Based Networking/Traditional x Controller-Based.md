Traditional networks and network management today are giving more and more space to controller-based management. This is because with more modern and converged networks, managing a large groups of devices can be quite challenging.

Not only does traditional networking take more time and effort to create and maintain (because traditional networks are mainly configured by hand on each device), bit it is also more prone to [[Network Automation Impacts|human error]].

Although traditional network configuration methods provide more fine-grained configurations, a **controller-based network** provides homogeneous configuration across the network, easy to use and integrate interfaces and separation and centralization of the [[Control, Data and Management Planes|control plane]] of the network.
