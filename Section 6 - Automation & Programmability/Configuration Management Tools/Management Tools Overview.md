*Configuration Management Tools* are a class of server applications that manage and provision configurations for network devices and other servers or hosts. Generally they are used to provide a homogeneous, compliant network topology configuration.

These management tools are needed in larger networks because of two main points:

- In larger networks, it is much more time consuming to manually configure one device at a time. If a network controller is not being used to do these configurations, a management tool can facilitate that;
- Even if device configurations were done one by one, these configurations can easily "drift" with time, causing network devices to be non-compliant with company policies or rules, and overall not standardized;

These tools have many ways to connect and manage devices, and they can not only manage network devices, but other types of devices as well, such as [[Servers|servers]], [[Virtual Machine|VMs]], end hosts and more.
