Access points can operate in other modes other than the default, according to the network needs:

- **Repeater**: the [[Access Points|access point]] will connect to another access point (with wireless), and repeat the signals sent from it. This can increase the [[Wireless Signal|signal range]], but generally degrades signal and affects performance;
- **WGB** (*Workgroup Bridge*): in WGB mode, a AP will connect to a client (like a PC for example) with a wire, and connect itself to the internet with wireless. This can be used to:
	- Connect clients that do not have wireless capabilities to a wireless network;
	- Extend the signal range of a wireless network;
