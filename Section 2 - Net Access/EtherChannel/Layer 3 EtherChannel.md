[[EtherChannel]] can be formed between layer 2 or layer 3 devices. When using [[Switches|multi-layer switches]], the `no switchport` command must be addressed before configuring the port-channel protocol and mode. Also, configurations on the interface (like trunk, allowed [[VLAN|VLANs]], [[Router On A Stick (ROAS)|sub-interfaces]], etc) should be done on the port-channel interface, and not the individual group ports.
