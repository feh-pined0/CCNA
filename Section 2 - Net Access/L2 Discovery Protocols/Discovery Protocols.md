In order to get data about a device's information using only layer 2 discovery protocols were invented. This is because it is good to have more information about which devices are neighboring one another, although generally it is considered a security risk to have discovery protocol traffic on the network.

These protocols can be used to share information like:

- [[Collisions and Errors|Duplex configuration]];
- Speed configuration;
- Neighbor device capabilities;
- IP addresses;
- [[Default and Native VLANs|Native VLANs]];
