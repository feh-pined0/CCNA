*Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus* is a Cisco developed (but not proprietary) AAA protocol. It is very similar to [[RADIUS]], although it was created later and has more robust authentication and authorization.

Also, while RADIUS support only encryption of the password on data traffic (leaving things like username in clear text), TACACS+ supports the encryption of the whole packet.
