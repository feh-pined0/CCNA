*Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service* is a network protocol that is used to authenticate network users and authorize network traffic (such as network access and network device access).

RADIUS is also called an AAA server (it stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting \[logging|auditing\]). It sits on a centralized, trusted part of the network and holds information on users (such as usernames, passwords and clearance levels). Any kind of authentication to access the network must go through it.

The RADIUS server is used so that networks can comply with the [[Authentication Methods|802.1x]] standard, where it acts as the authentication server (*AS*).
