Cisco switches have five default VLANs pre-configured:

- 1 - this is the default VLAN. All access switchports will be bound to this VLAN.
- 1002 to 1005 - these VLANs were used to bridge ethernet networks with other networks that did not use ethernet (such as token ring and fiber distributed data interface).
