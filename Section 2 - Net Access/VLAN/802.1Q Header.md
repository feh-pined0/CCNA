The IEEE 802.1Q standard, often called "dot1q", is a layer 2 extension for the ethernet header, that identifies the VLAN any given frame belongs to. It sits between the "Source" and "Type" fields of the frame:

It is 32 bits long:

Where:

- **TPID** (*Tag Protocol ID*): is always set to `0x8100`, and indicates that this frame is dot1q tagged;
- **PCP** (*Priority Code Point*): used for Class of Service, which prioritize traffic (QoS);
- **DEI** (*Drop Eligible Indicator*): indicates if the frame can be dropped in case the network is congested;
- **VID** (*VLAN ID*): the actual identifier of the tagged VLAN;
