Radio frequencies are used to send wireless signals. These frequencies are created by applying an alternating current to an antenna, which creates electromagnetic fields that propagate as waves.

These waves can be measured using:

- Amplitude: the maximum strength of the electric and magnetic fields. In the image below, both frequencies have the same amplitude;

- Frequency: the number of cycles the wave makes per given unit of time. In the image below, both frequencies have the same amplitude;
