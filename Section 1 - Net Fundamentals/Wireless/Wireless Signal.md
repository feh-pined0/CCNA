Wireless signals (also called radio frequencies) are what transport data over non wired medias. When implementing wireless network access, signal range and other signal parameters should be taken into account. In comparison, wired networks have similar limitations regarding media types ([[Single-Mode Fiber, Multi-Mode Fiber and Copper|copper and fiber]]) and cable lengths.

Wireless signals can be degraded by:

- **Signal range**: different frequencies have different wavelengths. This relation is inversely proportional, meaning that the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the shorter the signal range.
- **Signal traversal**: when traversing different bodies, radio frequencies suffer from **absorption** (the body transforms the frequency into heat), **reflection** (the body reflects the signal, making it difficult to reach the other side of the body), **refraction** (when the body makes the frequency travel at a different speed than in the air, causing frequency bends and latency), **diffraction** (when the frequency cannot go through the body and must travel around it) and **scattering** (when a material makes the frequency scatter in all directions).
- **Signal overlapping**: when multiple devices are using the same frequency ranges and channels, they can interfere with each other, causing signal degradation.
