Each wireless [[RF Bands|band]] is divided in multiple channels. Devices are configured to use these channels and thus transmit wireless signals using the frequencies defined in it.

The 2.4 GHz standard divides the band into 14 channels:

Note that some channel frequencies overlap with each other. This can cause interference, even when using different channels to transmit data.

> For this reason, it is a recommendation to use channels 1, 6 and 11 when deploying wireless LANs with more than 1 [[Access Points|access points]], this way, interference can be avoided.

Also, when deploying 2.4 GHz networks, the position of the access points should make so that channels do not overlap with each other. The recommendation is to use a "honeycomb" pattern, like so:

It is also essential to correctly measure signal range to make sure that the spacing between channels is correct and non overlapping.
