- **Frame control**: indicates the message type;
- **Duration/ID**: indicates the duration (in microseconds) that the channel will be used for transmission (in the case this frame is a control frame) or the identifier for the [[AP Authentication|association]] (in the case the frame is a management frame).                 
- **Addresses** (1-4): indicates the address of the sender, receiver, imediate receiver, and imediate sender of the frame (respectively);
- **Sequence control**: used to reassemble fragments (TCP);
- **QoS control**: used to prioritize traffic;
- **HT control**: used to enable High Throughput features;
- [[CRC checksum|FCS]]: same as ethernet;

Messages can be of the following types:

- **Management**: used to manage the BSS;
	- Beacon
	- Probe requests and responses
	- Authentication
	- Association
- **Control**: used to control the wireless media;
	- [[CSMA CD and CA|RTS]]
	- [[CSMA CD and CA|CTS]]
	- [[TCP|ACK]]
- **Data**: literal data sent using the RF media;
