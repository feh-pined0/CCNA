More often than not networks have a simple job: connecting some users to the internet. This may seem simple: route the traffic to the ISP and that’s it. But even networks with less than 10 users or so, still need a lot of stuff for the network to service these needs:

- Home users and small offices typically don’t have lots of servers and services they provide (many times, they don’t have any). Thus, they don’t need a lot of public IP addresses. They need to configure NAT;
- Although not to a lot of users, a small network generally requires different types of media to connect the endpoints to the network. So, we need to configure switching and wireless access points (WAPs);
- Data in this case (and in all cases) is important and should be protected. So, we need to set up firewalls and a minimum of security;
- In small offices, prioritizing a service can be very important. In these cases, we need to configure some degree of QoS.

You can see that, although the requirements for the network are of a small scale, they do exist and are important. To do all that, home networks generally use a single, centralized device, often called wireless router. On a small business network, it’s common to see some entry point specialized devices such as switches and routers.
