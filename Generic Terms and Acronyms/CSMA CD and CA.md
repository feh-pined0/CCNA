*Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection* and *Collision Avoidance* are two technologies that enable devices using a [[Ethernet Shared Media and P2P|shared media]] to communicate without causing multiple collisions on the media.

Collision Detection will have the device "listen" to the media and wait for it to be inactive before sending any data. Collision Avoidance has yet another feature where a device will also send a RTS (*Request To Send*) on the media and wait for a CTS (*Clear To Send*) before sending any data.
