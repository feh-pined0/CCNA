*Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability* is a triad of concepts that define key aspects of the network regarding data security.

- **Confidentiality**: only authorized users have access to data;
- **Integrity**: data should not be tampered with. Only authorized users should be able to change data;
- **Availability**: data should be available through the network for, and only for, authorized users.
