In a MAC address, the U/L bit (*Universal/Local Bit*) determines if the address is Universally or Locally assigned. A address is universally assigned when the manufacturer assigned a globally unique MAC address to this port/interface, and is locally assigned when a user configured a local, non-unique MAC address.

The U/L bit is the seventh bit of a MAC address:

- When it is 0, the address is Universally administered;
- When it is 1, the address is Locally administered;
