*Encryption* is the act of using a defined algorithm to obfuscate a imputed data. This algorithm can be very simple (like SHA-256) or very hard to crack (like AES). The harder the algorithm is to crack, the more resources it takes to run it.

The use of different encryption algorithms vary according to the case of use. Generally, easier to crack algorithms are used in conjunction with other, more sophisticated algorithm.
