*Variable Length Subnet Masking* is a type of subnetting strategy that divides the same network using different subnet masks. When doing this, two apparently identical networks can have different LANs, which is opposed to unique, static subnetting which forces each network to have it's own IP range.

Here is an [example](http://www.dltec.com.br/blog/redes/vlsm-conceitos-e-exemplo-para-o-ccna/) that demonstrate how it works (link in Portuguese/Brazil).
