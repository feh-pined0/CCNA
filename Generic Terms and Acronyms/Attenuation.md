>[...]Attenuation is the gradual loss of flux intensity through a medium. For instance, dark glasses attenuate sunlight, lead attenuates X-rays, and water and air attenuate both light and sound at variable attenuation rates.

For our study case, attenuation can affect the electric signals through copper wire and degrade this signal through long distances. In other words, the very copper which transfers the electric signals also degrades them.
