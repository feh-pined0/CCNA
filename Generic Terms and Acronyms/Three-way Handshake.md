The three-way handshake is a [[TCP]] mechanism that allows the protocol to establish a reliable connection between two endpoints. It begins by the client sending a TCP segment with the SYN flag set to the endpoint (will call it the server for this example), followed by a response segment from the server to the client with the ACK and SYN flags set (also called the SYN+ACK segment), acknowledging the previous segment and synchronizing. To end the handshake, the client send an ACK to the server.
